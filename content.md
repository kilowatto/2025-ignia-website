## **2\. SECTION: SOLUTIONS**

### **2.0. SOLUTIONS HUB LANDING PAGE (Main Entry Point)**

Goal: Provide high-level peace of mind. This page isn't about specs; it's about "Job Done".  
Hero Vibe: Calm, Professional, Burden Removed.  
HERO SECTION  
Headline: Don’t Buy Infrastructure. Buy Outcomes.  
Sub-headline: You don't want a server; you want a Fintech app that complies with CNBV. You don't want a backup; you want business continuity. We bundle our technology to solve the business problem, not just the technical one.  
CTA: Find Your Solution  
\[Visual Concept\]: An abstract representation of "Order from Chaos". A messy wireframe of a city on the left transforming into a clean, glowing, organized structure on the right.  
\[Image Prompt\]: A 3D transition from chaos to order. Left side: messy tangled glowing wires and floating disorganized data blocks in dark blue. Right side: the wires organize into a perfect, glowing symmetric futuristic city structure in warm orange and white. Clean background, high tech architectural style.  
THE IGNIA STANDARD (Global Differentiator)  
Headline: The "Never Naked" Policy.  
Body:  
In the industry, they sell you a "naked" server. If it gets hacked, it's your fault. If the disk fills up, it crashes.  
At Ignia, we refuse to operate like that. Every Solution below includes SecureOps 360°.  
That means the Watchtower (NOC), the Shield (Security), and the Medic (Remediation) are already included in the price. We don't sell infrastructure without protection. Period.  
\[Visual Concept\]: An icon or 3D badge showing a server rack encased in a translucent, glowing energy shield.  
\[Image Prompt\]: 3D icon of a black server rack unit enclosed in a protective, translucent orange spherical energy shield, hovering, soft reflection, white background, symbol of protection and security.  
**SOLUTION CATEGORIES (The Grid)**

* **SecureOps 360° (The Flagship):** Turn your chaotic IT department into a disciplined 24/7 operation.  
* **Private Cloud (Hosted & On-Prem):** The privacy of a bank vault, the agility of a startup.  
* **Business Resilience (DRaaS):** The "Undo" button for catastrophes. From ransomware to hurricanes, we get you back in minutes.  
* **Kubernetes DevOps Platform:** Powered by Shamanops. Deploy code, don't manage clusters.

### **2.1. SecureOps 360° (Formerly NOCaaS)**

*Strategic Note: Titled as a Product, described as a Service (NOC/Observability).*

Headline: We Watch The Screens. You Run The Business.  
Sub-headline: A managed Network Operations Center (NOC) service that turns "I think it's down" into "It's already fixed." We combine Full-Stack Observability with Military-Grade Remediation.  
**Note:** This service is the heartbeat of Ignia. It comes embedded in our **Private Cloud**, **Virtual Machines**, and **Kubernetes** offerings.

**Key Value Proposition:**

* **Full-Stack X-Ray:** We don't just see that "Server A is slow." We see that "Function B in your PHP code is causing a deadlock in the Database." We monitor the infrastructure, the network, the code, and the end-user experience simultaneously.  
* **Proactive Hygiene, Not Just Reactions:** Most outages are caused by missed patches or full disks. We automate the maintenance (Patching, Cleaning, Tuning) so the outage never happens.  
* **The "Kill Switch" for Ransomware:** Our agents don't just scan for viruses; they analyze behavior. If a process starts encrypting files, our AI stops it instantly and reverts the changes.

**Feature List (The "Scope"):**

* **Layer A: The Eyes (Deep Observability)**  
  * **Synthetic User Journeys:** We deploy "robot users" that simulate critical actions (e.g., "Add to Cart", "Login") every 5 minutes from multiple global locations. If the user experience degrades, we know before your real customers do.  
  * **APM (Application Performance):** We inject agents into your Java, .NET, Node.js, or PHP code to trace slow queries and identifying bottlenecks at the line-of-code level.  
  * **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** We track the browser load time, JavaScript errors, and device performance of your actual website visitors in real-time.  
  * **Network Traffic Analysis:** We visualize the flow of data packets to detect bandwidth hogs, latency jitters, and abnormal traffic spikes.  
* **Layer B: The Shield (Active Protection)**  
  * **Universal Patch Management:** We don't just update Windows/Linux. We automatically patch 200+ third-party applications (Adobe, Chrome, Java, Zoom) where most vulnerabilities hide.  
  * **Vulnerability Assessment:** Continuous scanning of your entire fleet to identify open ports, weak configurations, and CVEs before hackers find them.  
  * **Behavioral Anti-Ransomware:** Unlike traditional antivirus that looks for "signatures," our AI engine detects "encryption behaviors." It blocks the attack and automatically restores the affected files from a local cache.  
* **Layer C: The Hands (Remediation & Inventory)**  
  * **Instant Remote Remediation:** Our engineers have secure, one-click remote access (Terminal & Desktop) to fix issues without waiting for VPNs or passwords.  
  * **Predictive Hardware Health:** We monitor SMART disk attributes and hardware sensors to predict physical failures days before they crash the system.  
  * **Asset Intelligence:** A real-time inventory of every piece of hardware and software installed across your organization, helping you track licenses and obsolescence.

**CTA:** Audit My Infrastructure

### **2.2. Private Cloud as a Service (Powered by MicroCloud)**

Headline: 100% Dedicated, Canonical Certified Hardware. Shared Economics.  
Sub-headline: The privacy of bare metal, optimized for MicroCloud excellence, hosted in our racks to slash your overhead.  
Key Concept:  
We provision dedicated servers and storage that are strictly validated on Canonical's Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). You get single-tenant hardware that has been engineered specifically to run the MicroCloud stack without compromise. SecureOps 360° is built-in, meaning we monitor the hardware health 24/7 so you never worry about a failed drive.  
Architecture & Capabilities:  
Built on a reference architecture designed for speed and stability:

* **Certified for MicroCloud:** Every component is chosen to extract maximum performance from the Canonical stack.  
* **Ceph-Optimized Storage:** Our storage nodes aren't generic. They are certified to run Ceph distributed storage, ensuring high IOPS and zero bottlenecks for your data.  
* **Hyper-Converged Efficiency:** Seamlessly mix System Containers (LXD) for raw speed and Virtual Machines (VMs) for compatibility on the same cluster.  
* **Zero-Neighbor Noise:** Compute (CPU/RAM) and Storage are 100% yours. No sharing, no stealing.  
* **Automated Resilience:** If a node fails, workloads migrate instantly within your dedicated cluster.

**Cost-Optimization Model:**

* **Shared Control Plane:** We host the management layer (saving you licensing and resource costs).  
* **Shared Uplinks with QoS:** You ride on our carrier-grade internet backbone with **guaranteed bandwidth allocation**.  
* **The "Exclusive" Upgrade:** Need absolute isolation? We can provision a **Dedicated Control Plane** and **Private Dark Fiber/Uplinks** upon request.

**CTA:** Configure Private Cluster

### **2.3. Private Cloud On-Premise (Edge & Sovereign)**

Headline: The Certified Cloud Stack, Inside Your Building.  
Sub-headline: Data sovereignty meets Edge Computing. We deploy and manage the full MicroCloud stack in your facility, handling everything from hardware to SD-WAN connectivity.  
**Core Capabilities:**

* **Same Stack, Zero Latency:** We deploy the exact same **Canonical Certified Hardware** used in our datacenters directly in your office or factory.  
* **Hybrid Connectivity (SD-WAN):** We don't just plug it in. We implement **SD-WAN** architectures to securely bridge your On-Premise cluster with the Ignia Private Cloud or Public Clouds (AWS/Azure). It’s a unified hybrid fabric.  
* **Fog & Edge Ready:** Perfect for low-latency processing. Process sensitive data locally (Edge) and sync metadata to the cloud core (Fog).  
* **Carrier Management:** We handle the ISPs. We contract, install, and manage the internet links and dedicated fiber for your premise so you deal with one vendor.  
* **SecureOps 360° Included:** Even behind your firewall, our NOC monitors the health and security of the cluster 24/7.

Regional Availability:  
We are currently deploying active On-Premise clusters in Canada, United States, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. (Expansion to broader LATAM and the European Union coming soon).  
**CTA:** Discuss On-Premise Needs

### **2.4. Business Resilience & DRaaS (BCP)**

Headline: From "Data Recovery" to "Zero Downtime".  
Sub-headline: Whether you need a failover plan for a rainy day or an Active-Active architecture for mission-critical uptime, we orchestrate your survival.  
Tier 1: Hybrid DRaaS (The "Undo" Button)  
Powered by Acronis Cyber Protect Technology.

* **Concept:** A turnkey failover solution. We maintain a dormant replica of your servers in our **Virginia (USA)** or **Queretaro (MX)** regions.  
* **Ransomware Proof:** Your backups utilize **Immutable Storage (WORM)** technology. Even if a hacker gains admin access, they cannot delete or encrypt your history.  
* **Automated Runbooks:** We script the boot sequence (e.g., DB first, App second) ensuring a valid recovery state, not just a booted server.  
* **Connectivity:** Features **VPN-less** technology, giving your workforce instant secure access to the cloud replica without complex network reconfiguration.  
* **RTO (Recovery Time):** Minutes.

Tier 2: Active-Active Continuity (Near-Zero Downtime)  
Powered by Canonical MicroCloud, SD-WAN & Global Load Balancing.

* **Concept:** True geo-redundancy. We design a synchronized architecture where two locations serve traffic simultaneously.  
* **The Stack:**  
  * **Global Load Balancer (GLB):** Directs user traffic to the healthiest location (See *Products \> Load Balancer*).  
  * **Database Replication:** Real-time sync (MySQL/Postgres) ensures data exists in both sites.  
  * **SD-WAN Fabric:** Unifies the network mesh so IP addresses remain reachable.  
* **RTO (Recovery Time):** Instant / Near-Zero.

**The Orchestration Layer:**

* **Larry's Role:** In Tier 2, Larry monitors global latency. If a region fades, Larry autonomously updates DNS records to redirect traffic, faster than any human could react. (See *AI & Larry*).  
* **SecureOps 360° Execution:** Software fails; people don't. Our SecureOps team designs the plan and conducts **Mandatory Annual Recovery Drills** to prove your compliance to auditors.

**CTA:** Calculate your RTO

### **2.5. Kubernetes DevOps Platform (Powered by Shamanops)**

Headline: No-Code DevOps. Experience as a Service (EaaS).  
Sub-headline: Stop fighting with YAML files. We combine Ignia's robust Kubernetes infrastructure with Shamanops' intelligent orchestration to deliver a "Zero-Friction" deployment experience.  
The Strategic Alliance:  
Ignia Cloud provides the Certified Infrastructure (The F1 Engine). Shamanops provides the Autopilot (The Experience). Together, we allow your developers to deploy in minutes, not weeks.  
**Core Capabilities:**

* **YAML-Less CI/CD:** Connect your repo (GitHub/GitLab/Azure) and deploy. Shamanops handles the complexity of pipelines and manifests automatically.  
* **Built-in Security:** Automated vulnerability scans and encrypted secret management before your code ever hits production.  
* **FinOps & Observability:** Real-time cost analysis per deployment. Know exactly how much that new feature costs to run.  
* **Phoenix DRP:** Disaster Recovery for your apps. Redeploy your entire stack to a new region in minutes with a single flag toggle (complements our Tier 1 DRaaS).  
* **ChatOps Integration:** Approve deployments directly from Slack or Teams.

The SecureOps Factor:  
While Shamanops manages your Application Delivery, SecureOps 360° manages the Cluster Health. We patch the nodes, harden the OS, and monitor the control plane 24/7 so Shamanops always has a stable foundation to land on. Larry can consume Shamanops logs to provide predictive diagnostics.  
**CTA:** Start Deploying

### **2.6. Compliance Cloud for Fintechs**

Headline: The "Audit-Ready" Infrastructure Stack.  
Sub-headline: We don't just host your app; we generate the evidence required by CNBV and PCI-DSS. Logs, drills, and access controls are automated by SecureOps.  
**How We Achieve It (The Integrated Stack):**

* **Isolation (Private Cloud):** We deploy on dedicated hardware (Section 2.2), satisfying the "Single Tenant" requirement for banking data.  
* **Evidence of Continuity (BCP/DRaaS):** Compliance requires proof of survival. We provide the logs from your **Annual Recovery Drills** executed by our SecureOps team (Section 2.4).  
* **The Paper Trail (SecureOps 360°):** Auditors ask: "Who patched the server?" and "Who accessed the DB?". SecureOps automatically logs every intervention and patch, generating the exact reports auditors demand.  
* **Perimeter Defense:** WAF and DDoS protection (Cloud Firewall) are standard, covering PCI-DSS requirement 6.6 out of the box.

**CTA:** View Compliance Blueprints

### **2.7. Regulatory Backup & Archival**

Headline: 10-Year Memory. Zero Tampering.  
Sub-headline: "Digital Cement" for your legal data. We combine WORM (Write Once, Read Many) technology with long-term Object Storage to meet strict retention laws.  
**The "Set and Forget" Architecture:**

* **Immutable Chain:** Powered by our **Object Storage**, we apply an immutability lock. Once written, data cannot be modified or deleted—even by our own engineers—until the timer expires (5, 7, or 10 years).  
* **SecureOps Lifecycle Management:** You define the policy (e.g., "Keep Invoices for 5 years"); our SecureOps team configures the automated lifecycle rules so you never pay for storage you don't legally need.  
* **Encryption at Rest:** All archives are sealed with AES-256 encryption, ensuring that long-term retention doesn't become a long-term liability.

**CTA:** Define Retention Policy
