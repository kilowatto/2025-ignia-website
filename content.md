## **2\. SECTION: SOLUTIONS**

### **2.0. SOLUTIONS HUB LANDING PAGE (Main Entry Point)**

Goal: Provide high-level peace of mind. This page isn't about specs; it's about "Job Done".  
Hero Vibe: Calm, Professional, Burden Removed.  
HERO SECTION  
Headline: Don’t Buy Infrastructure. Buy Outcomes.  
Sub-headline: You don't want a server; you want a Fintech app that complies with CNBV. You don't want a backup; you want business continuity. We bundle our technology to solve the business problem, not just the technical one.  
CTA: Find Your Solution  
\[Visual Concept\]: An abstract representation of "Order from Chaos". A messy wireframe of a city on the left transforming into a clean, glowing, organized structure on the right.  
\[Image Prompt\]: A 3D transition from chaos to order. Left side: messy tangled glowing wires and floating disorganized data blocks in dark blue. Right side: the wires organize into a perfect, glowing symmetric futuristic city structure in warm orange and white. Clean background, high tech architectural style.  
THE IGNIA STANDARD (Global Differentiator)  
Headline: The "Never Naked" Policy.  
Body:  
In the industry, they sell you a "naked" server. If it gets hacked, it's your fault. If the disk fills up, it crashes.  
At Ignia, we refuse to operate like that. Every Solution below includes SecureOps 360°.  
That means the Watchtower (NOC), the Shield (Security), and the Medic (Remediation) are already included in the price. We don't sell infrastructure without protection. Period.  
\[Visual Concept\]: An icon or 3D badge showing a server rack encased in a translucent, glowing energy shield.  
\[Image Prompt\]: 3D icon of a black server rack unit enclosed in a protective, translucent orange spherical energy shield, hovering, soft reflection, white background, symbol of protection and security.  
**SOLUTION CATEGORIES (The Grid)**

* **SecureOps 360° (The Flagship):** Turn your chaotic IT department into a disciplined 24/7 operation.  
* **Private Cloud (Hosted & On-Prem):** The privacy of a bank vault, the agility of a startup.  
* **Business Resilience (DRaaS):** The "Undo" button for catastrophes. From ransomware to hurricanes, we get you back in minutes.  
* **Kubernetes DevOps Platform:** Powered by Shamanops. Deploy code, don't manage clusters.

### **2.1. SecureOps 360° (Formerly NOCaaS)**

*Strategic Note: Titled as a Product, described as a Service (NOC/Observability).*

Headline: We Watch The Screens. You Run The Business.  
Sub-headline: A managed Network Operations Center (NOC) service that turns "I think it's down" into "It's already fixed." We combine Full-Stack Observability with Military-Grade Remediation.  
**Note:** This service is the heartbeat of Ignia. It comes embedded in our **Private Cloud**, **Virtual Machines**, and **Kubernetes** offerings.

**Key Value Proposition:**

* **Full-Stack X-Ray:** We don't just see that "Server A is slow." We see that "Function B in your PHP code is causing a deadlock in the Database." We monitor the infrastructure, the network, the code, and the end-user experience simultaneously.  
* **Proactive Hygiene, Not Just Reactions:** Most outages are caused by missed patches or full disks. We automate the maintenance (Patching, Cleaning, Tuning) so the outage never happens.  
* **The "Kill Switch" for Ransomware:** Our agents don't just scan for viruses; they analyze behavior. If a process starts encrypting files, our AI stops it instantly and reverts the changes.

**Feature List (The "Scope"):**

* **Layer A: The Eyes (Deep Observability)**  
  * **Synthetic User Journeys:** We deploy "robot users" that simulate critical actions (e.g., "Add to Cart", "Login") every 5 minutes from multiple global locations. If the user experience degrades, we know before your real customers do.  
  * **APM (Application Performance):** We inject agents into your Java, .NET, Node.js, or PHP code to trace slow queries and identifying bottlenecks at the line-of-code level.  
  * **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** We track the browser load time, JavaScript errors, and device performance of your actual website visitors in real-time.  
  * **Network Traffic Analysis:** We visualize the flow of data packets to detect bandwidth hogs, latency jitters, and abnormal traffic spikes.  
* **Layer B: The Shield (Active Protection)**  
  * **Universal Patch Management:** We don't just update Windows/Linux. We automatically patch 200+ third-party applications (Adobe, Chrome, Java, Zoom) where most vulnerabilities hide.  
  * **Vulnerability Assessment:** Continuous scanning of your entire fleet to identify open ports, weak configurations, and CVEs before hackers find them.  
  * **Behavioral Anti-Ransomware:** Unlike traditional antivirus that looks for "signatures," our AI engine detects "encryption behaviors." It blocks the attack and automatically restores the affected files from a local cache.  
* **Layer C: The Hands (Remediation & Inventory)**  
  * **Instant Remote Remediation:** Our engineers have secure, one-click remote access (Terminal & Desktop) to fix issues without waiting for VPNs or passwords.  
  * **Predictive Hardware Health:** We monitor SMART disk attributes and hardware sensors to predict physical failures days before they crash the system.  
  * **Asset Intelligence:** A real-time inventory of every piece of hardware and software installed across your organization, helping you track licenses and obsolescence.

**CTA:** Audit My Infrastructure

### **2.2. Private Cloud as a Service (Powered by MicroCloud)**

Headline: 100% Dedicated, Canonical Certified Hardware. Shared Economics.  
Sub-headline: The privacy of bare metal, optimized for MicroCloud excellence, hosted in our racks to slash your overhead.  
Key Concept:  
We provision dedicated servers and storage that are strictly validated on Canonical's Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). You get single-tenant hardware that has been engineered specifically to run the MicroCloud stack without compromise. SecureOps 360° is built-in, meaning we monitor the hardware health 24/7 so you never worry about a failed drive.  
Architecture & Capabilities:  
Built on a reference architecture designed for speed and stability:

* **Hyper-Converged Efficiency:** Seamlessly mix System Containers (LXD) for raw speed and Virtual Machines (VMs) for compatibility on the same cluster.  
* **Zero-Neighbor Noise:** Compute (CPU/RAM) and Storage are 100% yours. No sharing, no stealing.  
* **Automated Resilience:** If a node fails, workloads migrate instantly within your dedicated cluster.

**Cost-Optimization Model:**

* **Shared Control Plane:** We host the management layer (saving you licensing and resource costs).  
* **Shared Uplinks with QoS:** You ride on our carrier-grade internet backbone with **guaranteed bandwidth allocation**.  
* **The "Exclusive" Upgrade:** Need absolute isolation? We can provision a **Dedicated Control Plane** and **Private Dark Fiber/Uplinks** upon request.

**CTA:** Configure Private Cluster

### **2.3. Private Cloud On-Premise (Edge & Sovereign)**

Headline: The Certified Cloud Stack, Inside Your Building.  
Sub-headline: Data sovereignty meets Edge Computing. We deploy and manage the full MicroCloud stack in your facility, handling everything from hardware to SD-WAN connectivity.  
**Core Capabilities:**

* **Same Stack, Zero Latency:** We deploy the exact same **Canonical Certified Hardware** used in our datacenters directly in your office or factory.  
* **Hybrid Connectivity (SD-WAN):** We don't just plug it in. We implement **SD-WAN** architectures to securely bridge your On-Premise cluster with the Ignia Private Cloud or Public Clouds (AWS/Azure). It’s a unified hybrid fabric.  
* **Fog & Edge Ready:** Perfect for low-latency processing. Process sensitive data locally (Edge) and sync metadata to the cloud core (Fog).  
* **Carrier Management:** We handle the ISPs. We contract, install, and manage the internet links and dedicated fiber for your premise so you deal with one vendor.  
* **SecureOps 360° Included:** Even behind your firewall, our NOC monitors the health and security of the cluster 24/7.

Regional Availability:  
We are currently deploying active On-Premise clusters in Canada, United States, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. (Expansion to broader LATAM and the European Union coming soon).  
**CTA:** Discuss On-Premise Needs

### **2.4. Business Resilience & DRaaS (BCP)**

Headline: From "Data Recovery" to "Zero Downtime".  
Sub-headline: Whether you need a failover plan for a rainy day or an Active-Active architecture for mission-critical uptime, we orchestrate your survival.  
Tier 1: Hybrid DRaaS (The "Undo" Button)  
Powered by Acronis Cyber Protect Technology.

* **Concept:** A turnkey failover solution. We maintain a dormant replica of your servers in our **Virginia (USA)** or **Queretaro (MX)** regions.  
* **Ransomware Proof:** Your backups utilize **Immutable Storage (WORM)** technology. Even if a hacker gains admin access, they cannot delete or encrypt your history.  
* **Automated Runbooks:** We script the boot sequence (e.g., DB first, App second) ensuring a valid recovery state, not just a booted server.  
* **Connectivity:** Features **VPN-less** technology, giving your workforce instant secure access to the cloud replica without complex network reconfiguration.  
* **RTO (Recovery Time):** Minutes.

Tier 2: Active-Active Continuity (Near-Zero Downtime)  
Powered by Canonical MicroCloud, SD-WAN & Global Load Balancing.

* **Concept:** True geo-redundancy. We design a synchronized architecture where two locations serve traffic simultaneously.  
* **The Stack:**  
  * **Global Load Balancer (GLB):** Directs user traffic to the healthiest location (See *Products \> Load Balancer*).  
  * **Database Replication:** Real-time sync (MySQL/Postgres) ensures data exists in both sites.  
  * **SD-WAN Fabric:** Unifies the network mesh so IP addresses remain reachable.  
* **RTO (Recovery Time):** Instant / Near-Zero.

**The Orchestration Layer:**

* **Larry's Role:** In Tier 2, Larry monitors global latency. If a region fades, Larry autonomously updates DNS records to redirect traffic, faster than any human could react. (See *AI & Larry*).  
* **SecureOps 360° Execution:** Software fails; people don't. Our SecureOps team designs the plan and conducts **Mandatory Annual Recovery Drills** to prove your compliance to auditors.

**CTA:** Calculate your RTO

### **2.5. Kubernetes DevOps Platform (Powered by Shamanops)**

Headline: No-Code DevOps. Experience as a Service (EaaS).  
Sub-headline: Stop fighting with YAML files. We combine Ignia's robust Kubernetes infrastructure with Shamanops' intelligent orchestration to deliver a "Zero-Friction" deployment experience.  
The Strategic Alliance:  
Ignia Cloud provides the Certified Infrastructure (The F1 Engine). Shamanops provides the Autopilot (The Experience). Together, we allow your developers to deploy in minutes, not weeks.  
**Core Capabilities:**

* **YAML-Less CI/CD:** Connect your repo (GitHub/GitLab/Azure) and deploy. Shamanops handles the complexity of pipelines and manifests automatically.  
* **Built-in Security:** Automated vulnerability scans and encrypted secret management before your code ever hits production.  
* **FinOps & Observability:** Real-time cost analysis per deployment. Know exactly how much that new feature costs to run.  
* **Phoenix DRP:** Disaster Recovery for your apps. Redeploy your entire stack to a new region in minutes with a single flag toggle (complements our Tier 1 DRaaS).  
* **ChatOps Integration:** Approve deployments directly from Slack or Teams.

The SecureOps Factor:  
While Shamanops manages your Application Delivery, SecureOps 360° manages the Cluster Health. We patch the nodes, harden the OS, and monitor the control plane 24/7 so Shamanops always has a stable foundation to land on. Larry can consume Shamanops logs to provide predictive diagnostics.  
**CTA:** Start Deploying

### **2.6. Compliance Cloud for Fintechs**

Headline: The "Audit-Ready" Infrastructure Stack.  
Sub-headline: We don't just host your app; we generate the evidence required by CNBV and PCI-DSS. Logs, drills, and access controls are automated by SecureOps.  
**How We Achieve It (The Integrated Stack):**

* **Isolation (Private Cloud):** We deploy on dedicated hardware (Section 2.2), satisfying the "Single Tenant" requirement for banking data.  
* **Evidence of Continuity (BCP/DRaaS):** Compliance requires proof of survival. We provide the logs from your **Annual Recovery Drills** executed by our SecureOps team (Section 2.4).  
* **The Paper Trail (SecureOps 360°):** Auditors ask: "Who patched the server?" and "Who accessed the DB?". SecureOps automatically logs every intervention and patch, generating the exact reports auditors demand.  
* **Perimeter Defense:** WAF and DDoS protection (Cloud Firewall) are standard, covering PCI-DSS requirement 6.6 out of the box.

**CTA:** View Compliance Blueprints

### **2.7. Regulatory Backup & Archival**

Headline: 10-Year Memory. Zero Tampering.  
Sub-headline: "Digital Cement" for your legal data. We combine WORM (Write Once, Read Many) technology with long-term Object Storage to meet strict retention laws.  
**The "Set and Forget" Architecture:**

* **Immutable Chain:** Powered by our **Object Storage**, we apply an immutability lock. Once written, data cannot be modified or deleted—even by our own engineers—until the timer expires (5, 7, or 10 years).  
* **SecureOps Lifecycle Management:** You define the policy (e.g., "Keep Invoices for 5 years"); our SecureOps team configures the automated lifecycle rules so you never pay for storage you don't legally need.  
* **Encryption at Rest:** All archives are sealed with AES-256 encryption, ensuring that long-term retention doesn't become a long-term liability.

**CTA:** Define Retention Policy

### **4.1. Custom AI Agents ("Build Your Own Larry")**

Headline: Don't Hire More Staff. Hire Agents.  
Sub-headline: Deploy autonomous digital workers capable of executing tasks, not just answering chat questions.  
Copy:  
Imagine an agent that monitors your sales email, checks inventory in your ERP, and replies to the customer—all without human intervention. We help you design and deploy agents that behave with the same reliability as our own "Larry".

* **Role-Based Agents:** Sales SDRs, L1 Support, Data Entry.  
* **24/7 Operations:** Agents don't take coffee breaks.

### **4.2. Visual Workflow Infrastructure (The Best Home for n8n)**

Headline: Run n8n Without Limits.  
Sub-headline: The ultimate self-hosted environment for visual automation. No execution caps, no timeouts, just raw power.  
Copy:  
SaaS automation platforms punish you for success with execution limits and slow shared workers. Ignia Cloud is the "Best Home for n8n" because we treat your workflows as critical workloads, not just scripts.

* **Unleashed Performance:** Powered by our **High-Performance VMs** (See Section 3), your workflows get dedicated vCPUs and NVMe storage. Process heavy datasets and run complex AI loops without hitting a "timeout" wall.  
* **Self-Hosted Freedom:** We provision the infrastructure; you own the instance. Install custom npm packages, access the file system, and connect to local databases securely.  
* **Cross-Product Power:** Seamlessly trigger jobs on your **Kubernetes Clusters** or scale up resources instantly when your agents get busy.

### **4.3. Multi-Model Gateway (The "Brain" Store)**

Headline: Model Agnostic. Intelligence Optimized.  
Sub-headline: Why lock yourself into one vendor? Switch between the world's best LLMs instantly based on performance or cost.  
Copy:  
Your workflow needs flexibility. We provide a unified API gateway that lets you route prompts to the best model for the job:

* **Google Gemini:** For massive context windows and multimodal analysis.  
* **OpenAI GPT-4o:** For complex reasoning and code generation.  
* **Anthropic Claude 3.5:** For nuanced writing and coding tasks.  
* **xAI Grok:** For real-time knowledge and unfiltered reasoning.  
* **Route Smart:** Use "Flash" models for fast tasks and "Pro" models for deep thinking.

### **4.4. Private Model Hosting**

Headline: Your Data, Your Infrastructure.  
Sub-headline: Run open-weights models (Llama 3, Mistral) on dedicated GPUs within your private VPC.  
Copy:  
Some data is too sensitive to send to a public API. We provision dedicated NVIDIA A100/H100 clusters where you run the model.

* **Zero Leakage:** Your prompts never leave your private cloud.  
* **Fixed Cost:** Pay for the GPU time, not per token.  
* **Fine-Tuning:** Train the model on your specific company documents.
